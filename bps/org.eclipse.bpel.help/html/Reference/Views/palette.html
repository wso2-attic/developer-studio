	<h1>Palette</h1>

	<p>
		The primary editing, creation and viewing tools of the BPEL Designer
		are accessed from the  <strong>Palette</strong>. The  <strong>Palette</strong>  can be
		docked either at the right or left edge of the BPEL Designer main
		window, or it can be detached and displayed in its own view.
	</p>

	<h5>Selection Tools</h5>
	<p>
		The  <strong>Selection Tool</strong> is used to select individual activities in the editors drawing
		canvas. Multiple activities can be selected by holding the <strong>CTRL</strong> or <strong>SHIFT</strong> 
		keys in combination with left mouse click. The  <strong>Marquee Tool</strong>  allows selection of 
		groups of activities by dragging a selection rectangle around them.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Tool Drawers</h5>
	<p>
		BPEL activities are created by dragging icons from the labeled <strong>Actions</strong>, 
		<strong>Controls</strong>  and <strong>Faults</strong>  palette sections
		(or drawers), onto the editor's drawing canvas. These sections can be collapsed and expanded 
		by clicking on individual palette section titles. They can also be <em>pinned</em>
		to prevent them from collapsing if another section is expanded.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Zoom Tools</h5>
	<p>
		The tools at the bottom of the  <strong>Palette</strong>
		are used to expand or shrink the drawing canvas.
