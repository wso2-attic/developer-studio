		The process name appears at the top of the Dashboard. The main
		Dashboard area lists all of the <strong>Partner Links</strong>,
		<strong>Variables</strong>, <strong>Correlation Sets</strong> and
		<strong>Message Exchanges</strong> currently
		defined for the process. The green plus symbol and grey x symbol allow
		you to add and delete each of these elements. In-line editing of all
		element names works by selecting the name and then clicking again to
		enable the editor.
