	<h1>XPath Expression Editor</h1>

	<p>
		The XPath expression editor provides context-sensitive assistance in
		the form of pop-up proposals. The light bulb icon indicates that
		content assist is available by pressing the <strong>CTRL</strong> and
		<strong>SPACE</strong> keys simultaneously. The editor will display
		appropriate help information based on what it knows about variables
		currently in-scope for the selected activity. An example is seen in
		the figure below:

	<h2>Note</h2>

	<p>
		The BPEL 2.0 specification provides for the definition of an
		XPath language version at the process level, as well as the activity
		level (for those activities that make use of XPath). However, only
		XPath 1.0 is supported by the BPEL Designer and the JBoss Riftsaw
		runtime engine at this time.
