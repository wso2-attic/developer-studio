	<h1>Structured Activities</h1>

	<p>
		Structured activities can be thought of as containers that can hold
		one or more activities. The <strong>Controls</strong> section of the <strong>Palette</strong>
		contains all of the <em>structured activities</em>.
		When you drag and drop one of these onto the drawing canvas, the BPEL
		Designer will create a basic skeleton of the activity, and assign
		default properties.
	</p>
	<p>
		All structured activities will require some additional
		configuration before they are considered valid. For example, BPEL does
		not allow an empty Sequence activity. Invalid structured activities
		will be decorated with an error icon similar to basic activities.</p>
	<p>
		Structured activities can be expanded and collapsed on the
		drawing canvas by clicking the plus and minus buttons at the bottom of
		the figure. Illustrated below is a collapsed and expanded Sequence:
	</p>

	<p><img src="../../..images/reference/BPEL_Designer_12.png" alt="Collapsed Sequence" /></p>
	<p><b>Collapsed Sequence</b></p>
	
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_13.png" alt="Expanded Sequence" /></p>
	<p><b>Expanded Sequence</b></p>

	<p>
		The following sections describe the structured activities and
		how each must be configured to be considered valid for BPEL.
	</p>

	<h5>If</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_14.png" alt="If, ElseIf and Else" /></p>
	<p><b>If, ElseIf and Else</b></p>
	<p>
		The If activity allows conditional execution of one or more
		sequences of activities. It consists of a sequence of one or more
		conditional branches defined by If and optional ElseIf elements. The
		elements are evaluated in left-to-right order (or top-to-bottom if you
		have selected horizontal layout). An optional Else branch will be
		executed if none of the other conditions are true.
	</p>
	<p>
		An If activity must define a condition (expressed as an XPath)
		and an activity which is executed if the condition evaluates true. To
		insert additional ElseIf and Else elements, right-click the If figure
		and select the desired element from the context menu. The figure above
		shows a complete If activity with optional ElseIf and Else elements.
	</p>

	<h5>Pick</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_15.png" alt="Pick" /></p>
	<p><b>Pick</b></p>
	<p>
		The Pick activity will cause the process to wait for one of any number
		of messages to be received. An optional timer can be set to limit the
		time to wait for receipt of these messages. Activities to handle
		receipt of messages and timer expiration are defined in the Pick.
		Message receipts are handled by OnMessage activities (
		<a href="#Reference-Details_tab-OnMessage">OnMessage</a>), and timer expiration is handled by the OnAlaram
		activity (<a href="#Reference-Details_tab-OnAlarm">OnAlarm</a>).
	</p>

	<h5>While</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_16.png" alt="While" /></p>
	<p><b>While</b></p>
	<p>
		The While activity repeatedly executes the contained activity as
		long as a condition evaluates true at the beginning of each iteration.
		A While activity must define a condition and must contain an activity.
	</p>

	<h5>ForEach</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_17.png" alt="ForEach" /></p>
	<p><b>ForEach</b></p>
	<p>
		ForEach is a looping activity that executes the activities
		contained in its Scope a specified number of times. A counter
		variable, defined in the ForEach property detail tab, is used to keep
		track of the iterations. The ForEach properties must be configured
		with starting and ending value expressions for this counter variable.
		The counter is initially set to the starting value and activities in
		the Scope are executed until the counter exceeds the ending value.
	</p>
	<p>
		This activity can also be configured to execute all iterations
		in parallel, meaning the enclosed Scope activity behaves as if
		multiple Scopes are enclosed in a Flow activity.
	</p>
	<p>
		An optional early termination value can be defined, which will cause
		the loop to complete before the counter has reached its ending value.
		The ForEach will complete when the counter is equal to this early
		termination value for the sequential execution case. For the parallel
		execution case, the early termination value is the number of completed
		iterations. For example, the ForEach completes when at least
		<em>some number</em> of <em>some action</em> have finished.
	</p>
	
	<h5>RepeatUntil</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_18.png" alt="RepeatUntil" /></p>
	<p><b>RepeatUntil</b></p>
	<p>
		The RepeatUntil activity repeatedly executes the contained
		activity as long as a condition evaluates true at the end of each
		iteration. A condition must be defined for a RepeatUntil, and it must
		contain an activity.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Sequence</h5>
	<p>
		A Sequence is a container for one or more other activities,
		which are executed in sequential order and (unlike Scope and Flow
		activities), has no other special characteristics. Because the
		conditional activities ( If, While, RepeatUntil and ForEach) can have
		only one activity as the target of their execution, a Sequence is
		typically used to execute multiple activities.
	</p>
	<p>For example, the If shown below contains only a single Assign activity:</p>
	
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_19.png" alt="Sequence" /></p>
	<p><b>Sequence</b></p>
	<p>
		If it were necessary to perform an assignment and then invoke
		another web service, the Assign and Invoke could be contained within a
		Sequence. The Sequence would then become the target of the If:
	</p>

	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_20.png" alt="Sequence" /></p>
	<p><b>Sequence</b></p>
	
	<h2>Note</h2>
	<p>
		The BPEL Designer will automatically create a  Sequence if you drag-drop a second
		activity into any of the conditional activities.
	</p>

	<h5>Scope</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_21.png" alt="Scope" /></p>
	<p><b>Scope</b></p>
	<p>
		A Scope provides a context for its enclosed activity. This
		context includes variables, partner links, message exchanges,
		correlation sets, event handlers, fault handlers, a compensation
		handler and a termination handler. These Scope contexts can be nested
		hierarchically where the root context is provided by the process
		itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		A Scope can be thought of as a compartmentalized sub-process. If the
		Scope is declared as being <em>isolated</em> , then the variables and
		partner links shared with the process are locked to prevent other
		concurrent Scopes from altering them while a Scope is executing. Scope
		may also be nested to any depth and all variables, partner links and
		others defined in a Scope, are inherited by its children. Refer to 
		<a href="#Reference-BPEL_Designer-Structured_Activities-Flow">Flow</a> for
		a discussion of concurrent execution.
	</p>

	<p>
		To be valid, a Scope must have a single activity. The typical
		use of a Scope activity is to invoke a service and wait for a response
		message or timeout. In the above figure, the Scope has defined a
		message variable and a partner link used to interact with the invoked
		service.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Flow</h5>
	<p>
		The Flow activity allows multiple activities to be executed in
		parallel. All activities or Sequences of activities that are contained
		in a Flow, are executed (or begun) at the same time by the BPEL
		engine. A Flow completes when all of its enclosed activities have
		completed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Parallel processing is typically used to save time by doing more than
		one thing at a time and as a result, speed up the process. However, in
		many situations several tasks can be started at the same time, but one
		or more tasks may depend on the successful completion of other tasks.
		This task dependency sequencing is called <em>synchronization</em> and
		is achieved using Links.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, a process that handles purchase orders for material
		goods needs to:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li><p>Calculate the total order price</p></li>
		<li><p>Calculate shipping costs for the order</p></li>
		<li><p>Send a customer invoice</p></li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		All of these activities can be started at the same time, however
		the shipping cost must be finalized before the total order price can
		be determined, and the invoice can be sent.
	</p>

	<p>
		To create a Link, right-click on the activity that must be completed
		first (the activity that is the <em>source</em> of the dependency) and
		select <strong>Add Link</strong> from the context
		menu. Next, move the mouse to the activity in the Flow that depends on
		this one (the <em>target</em>) and click the left mouse button to
		create the link.
	</p>
	<p>
		A Link is identified by a name that must be unique within the
		Flow. The BPEL Designer generates a reasonable default name, but you
		can change this in its properties. You can also add a test to the Link
		that defines the conditions for considering an activity to be
		complete. For example an activity in a Flow may require two pieces of
		information, provided by other services, in order to continue.
		Consider the process Flow shown below:
	</p>

	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_22.png" alt="Flow example" /></p>
	<p><b>Flow example</b></p>
	<p>
		In this example, the <em>Billing</em> department can begin preparation
		of a customer invoice, but it needs to know if sufficient stock is on
		hand to fulfill the order and if an outside vendor needs to provide
		the additional quantities ordered. The following condition would
		enable the Link so that execution can continue for the price
		calculation and customer invoicing:
	</p>

	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_23.png" alt="Link example" /></p>
	<p><b>Link example</b></p>
	
	<p>
		This process is only partially complete though as it does
		not consider the number of outside vendors, or if the total
		quantity being ordered can ever be filled.
	</p>
