	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Drawing Canvas</em> : This
				contains the graphical representation of the BPEL process and is
				displayed when the  <strong>Design</strong>

				 tab at the bottom of the editor window is selected. The primary
				mouse click action (default is left mouse button) on any of the
				activity names activates an in-line editor, allowing you to edit the
				process name. To finish editing, simply press the <strong>ENTER</strong>  key or change focus
				by clicking on a different window control.
			</p>
			<p>
				The  <strong>Source</strong>  tab
				displays the XML (text) representation of the process. Any changes
				made in one view are immediately reflected in the other. The default
				layout of activities is top-to-bottom, but can be changed to
				horizontal layout from the context menu.
			</p></li>
		<li>
				<em>Palette</em> : The primary
				editing, creation and viewing tools of the BPEL Designer are
				accessed from the tool  <strong>Palette</strong>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Dashboard</em> : Provides an overview of the BPEL process.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Property Sheet</em> : When an activity is selected in the drawing canvas, its properties are
			displayed in the tabbed  <strong>Properties</strong> sheet.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Outline</em> : This panel provides a structural view of the BPEL process.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The BPEL Designer will validate your business process every time it is
		saved. If an activity is found to be incomplete or incorrectly
		configured, it will be decorated with an error icon (red circle with
		an X) as for example the  Assign activity
		below:
	</p>
	
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_02.png" alt="Assign error" /></p>
	<p><b>Assign error</b></p>

	<p>Hovering your mouse over this icon will display an error message in a tooltip:</p>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_03.png" alt="Assign error with tooltip" /></p>
	<p><b>Assign error with tooltip</b></p>

		The remainder of this section discusses some basic BPEL concepts
		and how they relate to the BPEL Designer.
