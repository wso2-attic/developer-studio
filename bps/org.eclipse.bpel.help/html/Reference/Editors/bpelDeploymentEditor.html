	<h1>BPEL Deployment Descriptor Editor</h1>
	<p>
		Before a BPEL project can be deployed to the runtime engine, you must
		create what is called a <em>deployment descriptor</em>. This is simply
		a manifest file, serialized as XML, that describes all of the BPEL
		processes and their interfaces to the BPEL engine. The <em>deployment
			descriptor</em> file must be created in the root folder of your project.
		See <a href="#Reference-Wizard-Deployment_Descriptor">New BPEL Deployment Descriptor¬ù</a> more information.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <em>deployment descriptor</em> editor traverses the folder
		hierarchy in your project and searches for all BPEL files. Each
		process is then represented in a separate tab in the editor. The
		figure below shows two processes (HelloWorld and GoodbyeWorld). Each
		process must be configured before the project can be deployed.

		<li>
			Process selection tabs: Click on these tabs to display the configuration page for each process.
		</li>
		<li>
			Initial process state: The process can be deployed in either an <em>active</em>, <em>inactive</em> or <em>retired</em> state.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inbound interfaces selection: Select the WSDL port type that clients will use to invoke this service.
		</li>
		<li>
			Output interfaces selection: Each invoked service (if any) will require you to select its port type.
		</li>
		<li>
			Process-level monitoring events: Allow you to select which events are generated by the BPEL engine. This is currently
			unused but will be used in future for debugging the process.
		</li>
		<li>
			Scope-level monitoring events: The BPEL engine can be configured to generate monitoring events for each Scope defined in
			the process.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The only action required to configure a processes is to select
		the interfaces for inbound and outbound services used by the process;
		all other settings are optional.
