	<h1>Basic Activities</h1>

	<p>
		Basic activities are represented on the drawing canvas as rounded
		rectangles containing an icon and the user-defined name of the
		activity. The <strong>Actions</strong> section of the <strong>Palette</strong>
		contains all of the basic activities. For example: Assign, Invoke and
		Receive.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Most basic activities will require some additional configuration.
	</p>
						
	<h5 >Start and End</h5>
	<p>
		Every BPEL process has implicit Start 
		<img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_04.png" /> and End
		<img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_05.png" /> activities. These
		do not correspond to actual BPEL elements however, and are simply
		placeholders for visualizing the beginning and end of the process
		flow. 
	</p>
	
	<h5>Assign</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_06.png" alt="Assign activity" /></p>
	<p><b>Assign activity</b></p>

	<p>
		The Assign activity allows you to manipulate variables and message
		contents that are defined in the process.
	</p>

	<h5>Invoke</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_07.png" alt="Invoke activity" /></p>
	<p><b>Invoke activity</b></p>
	<p>
		The Invoke activity is used to send a message to an external service
		(one-way invocation), and optionally wait for a response (request and
		response). An Invoke can also define a compensation handler and a
		fault handler to handle exception conditions.
	</p>

	<h5>Receive</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_08.png" alt="Receive activity" /></p>
	<p ><b>Receive activity</b></p>
	<p>
		The  Receive activity will wait for
		a specific message type from a service client.
	</p>

	<h5>Reply</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_09.png" alt="Reply activity" /></p>
	<p ><b>Reply activity</b></p>
	<p>
		The  Reply activity is used to
		respond to clients with a specific message type, or fault
		message (if defined for the process interface).
	</p>

	<h5>Validate</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_10.png" alt="Validate Input activity" /></p>
	<p ><b>Validate Input activity</b></p>
	<p>
		The Validate activity is used to validate the values of
		variables against their XML Schema and WSDL data definitions. This
		includes the variable's data type as well as structure. If validation
		fails, the BPEL standard fault invalidVariables is thrown.
	</p>
	<p>
		Validation is typically performed just before sending messages
		to a partner or client, or after receiving a message to ensure the
		message contains all required data and that the data is as expected.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Wait</h5>
	<p><img src="../../../images/reference/BPEL_Designer_11.png" alt="Wait activity" /></p>
	<p ><b>Wait activity</b></p>
	<p>
		A Wait activity will delay process execution for a certain
		amount of time, or until a given date and time; this is typically used
		to invoke an operation at a certain time. For example to update
		process state hourly or daily, or to collect some information from
		another service at a certain time of day.
