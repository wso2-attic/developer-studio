	<p>
		Variables are used in BPEL to store
		inbound and outbound messages for examination and manipulation by the
		business logic; they can also be used to save intermediate results and
		the process state. There are three kinds of variable declarations:
		messages types, XML Schema types and XML Schema elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <strong>Details</strong> tab allows
		you to define the variable declared type and its structure by
		selecting from known types. Once a variable type has been defined, the
		structure of the variable is shown. Clicking on the hyperlink will
		open the WSDL or XML Schema editor for the selected type or element.
