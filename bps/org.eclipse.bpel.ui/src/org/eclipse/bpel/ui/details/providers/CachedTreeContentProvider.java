/**
 * An abstract content provider that caches the tree nodes as they are discovered.
 * 
 * This is useful for two reasons: it guarantees that the same object will be returned
 * until the cache is cleared (which is convenient for trees that wrap a different set
 * of model objects), and it handles the parent relationship automatically.
 * 
 * Note that the parent of a node will only be known if the node appeared in an array
 * previously returned by primGetChildren()!  The value UNKNOWN_PARENT is returned
 * as the parent of a node whose parent has never had primGetChildren() called on it.
 * null is returned as the parent of the root nodes, that is, those returned by
 * primGetElements().
